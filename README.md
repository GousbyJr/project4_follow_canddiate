# follow_your_canidate
Political app that allows you to follow your favorite presidential canidates

## Technical Requirements


**Your app must:**

* **Build a full-stack application** by making your own backend and your own front-end
* **Have an interactive front-end**. This will more than likely be React.
* **Be a complete product**. Hint: this probably includes CRUD functionality.
* **Implement thoughtful user stories** that are significant enough to help you know which features to build and which to scrap
* **Have a visually impressive design** to kick your portfolio up a notch and have something to wow future clients & employers
* **Be deployed online** so it's publicly accessible

## Planning & Deliverables

###### What will we be turning in?

### Project Planning Deliverables

#### You must review the following with your instructional team BEFORE you start to code.

Your proposals must include:

* **Scope:** 
What are you planning to build?- I plan on building a political app that will help users follow certain presidential canidates of their choosing in one centralized location. The app will provide current news, the canidates web pages, and videos of canidates speeches. It will also be mobile accessible.

What is the name of your application. What technologies do you plan to use? The name is .... The technologies I plan on using is React and learn Java for backend. Also ask classmates what they used to design their past projects.

What do you reasonably think you can implement in the allotted time period? Reasonably, I think I can implement a landing page with a sign in, I can sort canidates by user selection, install videos of speeches, api call for political news, put canidates on same page, have a separate page for each canidate for more information after clicked on. 

What are your reach goals?-my reach goals are to have the auth landing page open for different users, have display content custom to each user. Have a add canidate page(user can add canidate not currently on app), have Java work for the backend.

* **Wireframes:** What does MVP look like? -MVP is landing page, canidate page and canidates I follow page up and running. API works seemlessly, design done and output responds as directed
Sketch out what your core pages will look like and how they will work. Consider making a *paper prototype* to demonstrate and/or test key user interactions.

* **Data Models:** Draw out the models and any associations for your project in an entity relationship diagram (ERDs).

* **Milestones:** Outline the milestones/sprints in GitHub Project.

### Completed Project Deliverables

- A **working API**, hosted somewhere on the internet- https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?sources=google-news&apiKey=722391b8a06d4099ad3f1a39b6ab915e , https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?country=us&category=business&apiKey=722391b8a06d4099ad3f1a39b6ab915e
- A handmade front-end **that consumes your own API**, hosted somewhere on the internet
- A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
- A link to your **repository hosted on Github Enterprise**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the _very beginning_ of the project
- **A `README.md` file** with:
    - Explanations of the **technologies** used
    - A couple of paragraphs about the **general approach you took**
    - **Installation instructions** for any dependencies
    - Link to your ERDs - Diagrams of your models and their relationships.
    - Link to your **wireframes** â€“ sketches of views and interfaces in your application
    - Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **hurdles** you had to overcome

## Asking for Help

**You are going to encounter a ton of unexpected errors and problems.**

Expect to come up against a lot of what can **seem** like roadblocks. Push forward and through; these are amazing learning opportunities. A lot of students treat errors during projects as just getting in the way of "finishing". The point of this project is **not** to finish everything; the point is to integrate your knowledge and deepen your understanding of how to put apps together.

Errors provide the most valuable source of information about gaps in our understanding. Seeing an error as "it's not working" and randomly changing code until "it works" will make everything worse. Spending time thoughtfully debugging issues is a fantastic investment that will lead to greater mastery and understanding.

**Pro-Tip** - 'Failure is a temporary state.'

## Suggested Ways to Start

* **Donâ€™t get too caught up in too many awesome features** â€“ simple is always better. Build something impressive that does one thing well.
* **Design first.** Planning with wireframes before writing code means you won't get distracted changing your mind â€“ you'll know what to build, and you can spend your time wisely by just building it.
* **Donâ€™t hesitate to write throwaway code** to solve short term problems.
* **Read the documentation for whatever technologies / frameworks / APIâ€™s you use**.
* **Write your code DRY** and **build your APIs RESTful**.
* **Commit early, commit often.** Donâ€™t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **Write code another developer wouldn't have to ask you about**. Do your naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at your app and understand what everything is?
* **Make it all well-formatted.** Are you indenting, consistently? Can we find the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc?
* **Comment your code.** Will someone understand what is going on in each block or function? Even if it's obvious, explaining the what & why means someone else can pick it up and get it.
* **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.

## Process

**Do not** immediately jump into coding.  For your thesis project you want to carefully plan your approach.

- Database: Draw out the tables and columns you plan to use in your database (ERDs - Entity Relationship Diagram)
- Wireframes: Detail the flow of your app through simple wireframes
  * You can choose whether you want to whiteboard the wireframes, use some program or just sketch it out with pencil and paper.
- Routes: Design the HTTP route architecture of your application using  [RESTful conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#Applied_to_Web_services)
- Schema & Seeds: When you are confident with your ERD, define its tables in SQL and put into a schema file. For easier testing, write a seed file as well to insert sample data to your database.
- Models: Write a model with methods that perform CRUD on the database.

## Random Fun Things You Could Check Out (Definitely not required):
* React Native - Use React to build a native application!
* Websockets - Use JS to build a communication app!
* Raspberry Pi - Use JS to build a robot/IoT project
* D3 - Build beautiful graphs and visual experiences for data.

---

## Project Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, and/or task tracking as specified above?

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?
